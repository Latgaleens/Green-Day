<p><b>Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist
        and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the 
        band's career, they have been a trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990
        before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason
        White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.

        in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout!
        Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a 
        breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited
        alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, the Offspring, and Rancid, with popularizing
        mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.
